## Lesson Aims:
* Be familiar with the concept of a hash table and its uses.
* Be able to apply simple hashing algorithms.
* Know what is meant by a collision and how collisions are handled using rehashing.

## Hash Tables 
A hash table is a data structure that creates a mapping between keys and values. Watch this video to get a comprehensive overview of what a hash table is. It also covers what collisions are and how they are handled! Make sure you take notes!

Now you've seen that, you should be able to:
- [x] know what is meant by a collision and how collisions are handled using rehashing.
- [x] understand the concept of a hash table and its uses.

You should now get some hands on experience with hash tables by completing
