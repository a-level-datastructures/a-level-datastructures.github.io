## Lesson Aims:
* Be aware of a graph as a data structure used to represent more complex relationships.
* Be familiar with typical uses for graphs.
* Be able to explain the terms:
  * graph
  * weighted graph
  * vertex/node
  * edge/arc
  * undirected graph
  * directed graph
* Know how an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list may be used to represent a graph.
* Be able to compare the use of adjacency matrices and adjacency lists.

## Definitions
* **Graph:** A graph is a diagram modelling between objects of a certain collection consisting of **edges** (lines) and **vertices** (dots)
* **Weighted Graph:** A weighted graph has numerical values attached to its edges. This is useful for many reasons, for example if you want to express distance between vertices
* **Vertex** A vertex is one of the dots that forms the graph
* **Edge:** An edge is a line connecting two vertexes (dots) within the graph
* **Undirected Graph:** An undirected graph is a graph where all the edges are **bidirectional**. This means that you can travel both ways along all the edges
* **Directed Graph:** A directed graph is a graph where the edges are **unidirectional**. This means they are all like one way streets, and you can only travel one direction along them

Now you know
- [x] The neccessary definitions for graphs

## Graph Uses
Graphs can be used to model complex relationships, such as the following networks:
* Navigation Systems
* Data Transmission
* Web Page Links
* Social Media Trends

Now you can state:
- [x] typical uses for graphs.
- [x] that graphs can be used as a data structure used to represent more complex relationships.

## Adjacency Matrices and Adjacency Lists
Watch this video, and go over the questions in the slides to get a good understanding for Adjacency Matrices and Adjacency Lists! Make sure to take notes.

## Congratulations
You can now:
- [x] describe how an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list may be used to represent a graph.
- [x] compare the use of adjacency matrices and adjacency lists.
