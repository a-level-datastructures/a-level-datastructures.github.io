### :evergreen_tree: Lesson Aims :evergreen_tree:
* Know that a tree is a connected, undirected graph with no cycles.
* Know that a binary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has at most two children.
* Be familiar with typical uses for rooted trees
* Know that a rooted tree is a tree in which one vertex has been designated as the root. 
* A rooted tree has parent-child relationships between nodes.
* The root is the only node with no parent and all other nodes are descendants of the root.

## Rooted Trees

Rooted Trees have one vertex designated as the root. All the other vertexes are implicity directed away from the root.
This video here will give you a visual overview of what this definition actually means.

## Parent Child Relationship
* In the below image you can clearly see the parent child relationship:
  * 2, which is at the root of the tree, has all the other nodes as it's descendants.
  * 2 clearly doesn't have any parents; nothing points to it!
  * The leafs `[2, 10, 5, 11, 4]` at the bottom of the tree have no descendants.
  * Picturing the below image as a 'family tree' makes it much easier to picture the parent child relationship.

Now you know:
- [x] that a rooted tree is a tree in which one vertex has been designated as the root.
- [x] a rooted tree has parent-child relationships between nodes.
- [x] the root is the only node with no parent and all other nodes are descendants of the root.
